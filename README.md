# CRM Data Analytics

#### This is a dataset of Customer Relationship Management that has 5 tables Account, Leads, Opportunity, Product Opportunity, Users
#### Each table contains at least 30 columns with messy data and lots of null values. In the data cleaning task, I removed columns which are not relevant to the the KPIs after making a copy of the original dataset

### Business Objective:
Clean the data in csv files, remove unwanted columns, impute null values, remove duplicates etc.
Load the data into the MySQL database server and then retrieve the KPIs to create a dashboard in Tableau Desktop
Connect MySQL with Tableau Desktop, Create Calculated columns and create a beautifull dashboard of Leads and Opportunity table
With the help of Data Modeling, join the tables with the help of primary and foreign key to achieve following KPIs
